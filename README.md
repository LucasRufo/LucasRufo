## Hello, I'm Lucas Rufo ðŸ’»

I have been working as a software engineer since 2019 and I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I like to learn new technologies and to keep track of all the topics I've learnt or that I want to learn someday, hence this [repo](https://github.com/LucasRufo/notes) (almost all the content is written in Portuguese).

Currently, I'm working mostly with .NET and C#, but I have a strong will to learn and work with Go at some point.

If you'd like to talk to me, please hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lu_rufo) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-rufo).
